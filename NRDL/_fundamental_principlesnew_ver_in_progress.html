    <h3>Welcome to <a href="https://www.nrdl.org">NRDL.org</a>, Natural Rights Defense League. 
        <br>Please excuse the incomplete site. It's under construction.</h3>
<hr>
<b>THIS PAGE IS UNDER CONSTRUCTION AND A LOT OF WORK TO DO HERE, STARTING WITH ORGANIZING SOME "SOURCES OF AUTHORITY" BY TOPIC, TO USE FOR FINISHING A "NOTICE OF CLAIM" TEMPLATE (WHICH I'M WORKING ON NOW), SO HERE IS THE PLAN FOR THIS PAGE NOW...</b><br>
<br>
1st I plan to put the Contents from the "LawDocs" "For Police Encounters" and "Justice System, Basic Rules" and the current "Notice of Claim of Deprivation of Rights Under Color of Law" here first, and try to better organize these "fundamental principles", and combine a LOT of past work, find the best "sources of authority" from "the supreme Law of the Land", and put links to them and the best quotes here, for making legal documents like this Notice of Claim Template I'm working on now (I need these for this next step hence why this is the current task now).<br>
<br>
Here is a link to where to get those "LawDocs" for now: <a href="https://www.nrdl.org/lawdocs/">www.NRDL.org/lawdocs/</a><br>
<hr>
<br>
Now to try and better summarize these "fundamental principles" of "Law" as I have learned to explain them, to Police and Courts and people I meet wherever I go (I need to make these as efficient as I can now, and add "sources of authority" from "the supreme Law of the Land" for ALL of them now)...
<br><br>
1) The Purpose of Government is essentially only to protect equal Human rights, the Liberty to pursue Happiness above all, and all "Public Servants" "shall be bound by oath or affirmation to support" "the supreme Law of the Land" and only those "Laws" "made in Pursuance thereof" but not "any Thing... to the Contrary". Therefore to punish "We the People" who "ordain and establish" "the supreme Law of the Land" just for disobeying orders or legislation from our hired "Public Servants" is exactly the opposite of the very purpose of law and govt, and could be considered "treason"!;
<br><br>
2) Therefore there must be "probable" evidence of an actual "crime" against another Human beings equal "individual rights" for ALL "searches and seizures" and "criminal prosecutions"!;
<br><br>
3) Therefore, for a "crime" to exist there must be some actual or "probable" threat or harm to another Human beings equal "individual rights" (aka "Corpus Delicti"), caused by "intent or inexcusable neglect" of the accused "defendant(s)" (aka "Mens Rea"), and violation of valid criminal "Law of the Land" where the "crime" is alleged to have happened.;
<br><br>
4) Those basic Human rights include the right to own land, to free travel on public roads, to fair exchanges like payment for labor, to common practices like law and medicine, and to privacy in general.;
<br><br>
5) Therefore to "tax" or "license" or "infringe" these basic natural Human rights in any way is a "deprivation of rights under color of law" which is an actual "crime" and a civil Liability to even "neglect to prevent" for "public servants" here in the USA!;
<br><br>
6) Therefore "We the People" need only "state... true full name" or reserve "the right to remain silent" when police detain us, which can only be "lawful" when they do have "probable cause" to accuse us of an actual "crime" against another Human beings equal "individual rights". 
<br><br>
... This means basically all HARMLESS civil and criminal "offenses" are not enforceable, as you can SEE me demonstrate in these videos with police, and the public court records of cases I got dismissed, like the last one I posted here many times.
<br><br>
...Now I need to go over this and the sources of authority and the current notice and make one template that will work better that what I have so far, and then finish some civil suits and/or writs of mandamus and criminal complaints and whatever else I need as I go along here. Hopefully I have all the "sources of authority" I need now.<br>

<br>
<b>WARNING: FAILURE TO RESPOND PROPERLY AMOUNTS TO CONSENT/ADMISSION BY 'TACIT CONSENT'.[1]</b><br>
NOTICE, "the supreme Law of the Land" states: "Every person" who causes any other person "to be subjected ...to the deprivation of any rights, privileges, or immunities secured by the Constitution and laws", "under color of any statute", mandate, etc... "shall be liable to the party injured..."[2].  See “Sources of Authority” at end of Notice. <br>
<br>
DECLARATION OF 'FUNDAMENTAL PRINCIPLES' OF 'THE COMMON LAW' AND 'THE SUPREME LAW OF THE LAND':<br>
<br>
  "We the People" of "the United States of America", "ordain and establish" "the supreme Law of the Land", "in order to... establish Justice... and secure the Blessings of Liberty to ourselves and our Posterity"[3,a], to protect and maintain equal individual Human rights, and "A frequent recurrence to fundamental principles is essential to the security of individual rights, and the perpetuity of free government."[4]<br>
<br>
  "We hold these truths to be self-evident, that all [Humans] are created equal, that they are endowed by their Creator with certain unalienable Rights, that among these are Life, Liberty and the pursuit of Happiness"[5], to own property[3,b], keep and bear arms[3,c], to free speech[3,d] and free travel[6], to fair exchanges[7], to carry on any common practice[8], and to "due process of law"[3,e] which requires for all "searches and seizures"[3,f] and "In all criminal prosecutions"[3,g] "probable" evidence[3,f] of an actual "crime"[9] against the equal "individual rights" of another Human being (aka 'Corpus Delicti'), caused by "intent or inexcusable neglect" of the accused suspect (aka 'Mens Rea'), and violation of valid[11], criminal, "Law of the Land"(aka 'Actus Reus')[9], and not just failure to "obey" "orders" or "legislation" from our hired Public Servants.  Such "colorable laws" are a "deprivation of rights under color of law"  which is an actual "crime" to "make or enforce" and a "civil offense" to even "neglect to prevent"[10].<br>
<br>
  "We the People"[3] also "hold these truths to be self-evident", "That to secure these rights, Governments are instituted among [Human Beings], deriving their just powers from the consent of the governed, --That whenever any Form of Government becomes destructive of these ends, it is the Right of the People to alter or to abolish it, and to institute new Government, laying its foundation on such principles and organizing its powers in such form, as to them shall seem most likely to effect their Safety and Happiness"[5]; And "that mankind are more disposed to suffer, while evils are sufferable, than to right themselves by abolishing the forms to which they are accustomed."[5]<br>
<br>
  This means that all "Victimless Crimes" and harmless Civil "Offenses"[3,e,f,9], as well as "taxes" on property ownership (especially land)[3,b], any "fair exchange" such as compensation for labor[7], "licenses" for any "common practice" such as that of law or medicine[8], and to travel on public roads for personal needs "in the conveyances of the day"[6], are all "Contrary" to these "fundamental principles" of "the common law" and "the supreme Law of the Land", and are therefore "deprivation of rights under color of law"[10] for which people are "not entitled to immunity" when they "make or enforce" or even "neglect to prevent" when they "reasonably should know" and can prevent[10], as in after a Notice such as this one.<br>

<b>HERE IS HOW I HAVE THE CURRENT "LawDoc.2_'THE LAW' FOR POLICE ENCOUNTERS_(2.27.2022_.pdf file for printing)":</b>
<br><br>
LawDoc 2, “THE LAW” FOR POLICE ENCOUNTERS, <br>
_____NOTICE OF ALL PUBLIC SERVANTS PERSONAL LIABILITY…______<br>
------------[Keep On Person-Legal Document-See Note @ End *. Obviously, underlines, bold & all caps in quotes are added for emphasis]-----------<br>
1st, WHEN STOPPED BY COPS: [Note: If you ARE exercising a ‘privilege’ which requires a ‘license’, you may need to show it (See #9-‘Free Travel’), otherwise…]…    …  SAY TO OFFICER: “First, I need to get out my camera to record ALL Police Encounters for evidence in court and this “LawDoc” to read the actual law on camera…” …    [If the ‘Public Servant’ objects recite these: “…officers are public officials carrying out public functions, and the First Amendment requires them to bear bystanders recording their actions.” Fields v. City of Philadelphia, 3d Cir. 2017); “no ‘reasonable expectation of privacy’ in Public”: US v. Jones, 2011;  FLORIDA v. JARDINES, 2012;  United States v. Knotts, 460 U.S. 276 (1983);  MISSOURI v. MCNEELY, 2012 ] …<br>
…  THEN SAY:  “After this moment you ‘reasonably should know’ that in the U.S. all Public Servants are PERSONALLY liable, ESPECIALLY if they refuse to let me explain ‘the Law’ to THEM, if they ‘make or enforce’ or even ‘neglect to prevent’ ‘any Thing… to the Contrary’ of THESE ‘clearly established’ ‘fundamental principles’, or ‘The Common Laws’ of Human-Kind, and ‘the supreme Law of the Land’ in these United States of America!  AND, since you VOLUNTARILY swore an oath ‘to support’ and defend ‘the supreme Law of the Land’, WHICH IT REQUIRES IN ORDER TO PREVENT EXACTLY THIS sort of ‘color of law abuse’, YOU ARE 'NOT entitled to immunity' for 'just following orders'! … SO…WHAT 'PROBABLE' 'EVIDENCE' DO YOU HAVE TO ACCUSE ME OF VIOLATING ANY 'INDIVIDUAL RIGHTS'?  IF NONE, HERE IS WHY THIS IS A ‘COLOR OF LAW ABUSE’…”<br>
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br>
       1)  THE PURPOSE OF GOVERNMENT= “We the People of the United States… ordain and establish” “the supreme Law of the Land”, “in order to form a more perfect Union, establish Justice, insure domestic Tranquility, provide for the common defence, promote the general Welfare, and secure the Blessings of Liberty to ourselves and our Posterity” (Preamble, U.S. Const.), and in Arizona’s Constitution, ONLY: “to protect and maintain individual rights”, and “A frequent recurrence to fundamental principles is essential to the security of individual rights and the perpetuity of free government.”! (Az. Const., Art.2, Sec.1&2) ‘any Thing’ more or less than ‘protect… individual rights’ violates the 1st Duty to the Constitution! <br>
       2)  PROBABLE CAUSE, RIGHT TO PRIVACY, SEARCHES & SEIZURES:  FOR ALL 'searches and seizures', 'the supreme Law of the Land' REQUIRES 'probable' evidence I have caused some type of ‘harm’ to another human or their ‘equal’ ‘individual rights’, or it is a ‘color of law abuse’ and/or ‘deprivation of rights under color of law’, rights to privacy and security from ‘unreasonable searches and seizures’, because in the U.S. we need ONLY ‘state…true full name’ when stopped by police and ONLY when there IS ‘probable’ evidence enough to make a ‘reasonable and prudent’ person suspect the accused of a ‘crime’!  “Police power exercised without probable cause is arbitrary. To say that the police … may detain them upon reasonable suspicion is to say, in reality, that the police may both accost and detain citizens at their whim.”, “To give the police greater power than a magistrate is to take a long step down the totalitarian path.”. “One has an undoubted right to resist an unlawful arrest, and courts will uphold the right of resistance in proper cases.”.  “There is no war between the Constitution and common sense.”<br>
    ARS  13-2412. Refusing to provide truthful name when lawfully detained:  “A. It is unlawful for a person, after being advised that the person's refusal to answer is unlawful, to fail or refuse to state the person's true full name on request of a peace officer who has lawfully detained the person based on reasonable suspicion that the person has committed, is committing or is about to commit a crime… but shall not be compelled to answer any other inquiry of a peace officer.  …a class 2 misdemeanor.” [From: azleg.state.az.us/ars/13/02412.htm ]<br>
       3) PROOF THERE MUST BE 'INJURY OR HARM' FOR 'REASONABLE CAUSE' TO ACCUSE YOU OF A 'CRIME'... <br>
        A) "The "case or controversy" requirement of Art. III of the Constitution defines with respect to the Judicial Branch the idea of separation of powers on which the Federal Government is founded, and the Art. III doctrine of "standing" has a core constitutional component that a plaintiff must allege personal injury fairly traceable to the defendant's allegedly unlawful conduct and likely to be redressed by the requested relief." Allen v. Wright, 468 U.S. 737 (1984), U.S. Supreme Court. [supreme.justia.com/cases/federal/us/468/737/case.html  ]  ;  B) 'Body of Evidence' of a 'Crime'... "Corpus delicti consists of a showing of 1) the occurrence of the specific kind of injury and 2) someone's criminal act as the cause of the injury." Johnson v. State, 653 N.E.2d 478, 479 (1995), Supreme Court of Indiana.,[leagle.com/decision/19951131653NE2d478_11117.xml/JOHNSON%20v.%20STATE ]  ;  C)  “the State must produce corroborating evidence of “corpus delecti,” showing that injury or harm constituting crime occurred and that injury or harm was caused by someone’s criminal activity.” Jorgensen v. State, 567 N.E.2d 113, 121 (1991), Court of Appeals of Indiana, 4th District.  [leagle.com/decision/1991680567NE2d113_1672.xml/JORGENSEN%20v.%20STATE ]  ;  D) “To establish the corpus delecti, independent evidence must be presented showing the occurrence of a specific kind of injury and that a criminal act was the cause of the injury.” Porter v. State, 391 N.E.2d 801, 808-809 (1979), Supreme Court of Indiana.,[leagle.com/decision/19791192391NE2d801_11166.xml/PORTER%20v.%20STATE ]  ;  E)  "the duty of this Court, as of every judicial tribunal, is limited to determining rights of persons or of property, which are actually controverted in the particular case before it."  Tyler v. Judges of Court of Registration, 179 U.S. 405 (1900), and California v. San Pablo & Tulare R. Co., 149 U.S. 308 (1893), U.S. Supreme Court.  [supreme.justia.com/cases/federal/us/179/405/case.html ; supreme.justia.com/cases/federal/us/149/308/case.html]<br>
       4)   THE OATH: “I …name… do solemnly swear (or affirm) that I will support the Constitution of the United States and the Constitution and laws of the State of Arizona, that I will bear true faith and allegiance to the same and defend them against all enemies, foreign and domestic, and that I will faithfully and impartially discharge the duties of the office of (name of office) according to the best of my ability, so help me God (or so I do affirm).“-(ARS 38-231) ; There is no ‘immunity’ when a ‘Public Servant’ ‘reasonably should know’ they were violating ‘clearly established law’, like the Constitution! New Times/Lacey v Maricopa/Arpaio (US Dist.Ct.2011);  Hartman v Moore, Saucier v Katz, Burns v Reed, etc. (US Supreme Court).<br>
       5)  ‘DEPRIVATION OF RIGHTS UNDER COLOR OF LAW’, ‘COLOR OF LAW ABUSE’: Includes… under US codes like 42-1983&1986 for Civil Liability and 18-241&242 for ‘criminal’ ‘conspiracy to commit’, to ‘make or enforce’ 'any Thing...to the Contrary' of these 'clearly established laws' IS a 'crime', called 'color of law abuse' (see USC 18-241&242), and Public Servants are PERSONALLY Liable for ‘failure to keep from harm’ or ‘neglect to prevent’ 'deprivation of rights under color of law'! (Civil offense: USC 42-1983&1986. see fbi.gov definition page)!<br>
       6)   THE RIGHT TO FREE TRAVEL:  ‘Held... The right to travel is a part of the "liberty" of which a citizen cannot be deprived without due process of law under the Fifth Amendment. ...as early as the Magna Carta.’ (Kent v. Dulles, 357 U.S. 116, 1958, U.S. Supreme Court!);  Such "A law... is unconstitutional, and a person faced with such a law may ignore it and exercise his First Amendment rights." (Shuttlesworth v. City of Birmingham, 394 U.S. 147, 1969); ‘The right of a citizen to travel upon the public highways... is a common right...to use the ordinary and usual conveyances of the day...to operate an automobile thereon... It is not a mere privilege, like... moving a house... or transporting persons or property for hire along the street, which a city may permit or prohibit at will.’ (THOMPSON v. SMITH, Supreme Court of Virginia, Sep 11, 1930);  ". . . [T]he right finds no explicit mention in the Constitution.... freedom to travel throughout the United States has long been recognized as a basic right under the Constitution." (Shapiro v. Thompson, 394 U.S. 618, 1969).  <br>
       7)  ‘COLORABLE LAW’= The Constitution for the United States of America is ‘the supreme Law of the Land’ and ‘No State shall make or enforce’ ‘any Thing…to the Contrary’!  All Laws must be construed in Harmony! 'An unconstitutional act is not a law… It is in legal contemplation as inoperative as though it had never been passed.' ‘any Thing…to the Contrary’ of these ‘fundamental principles’ is therefore ‘notwithstanding’ in a ‘court of law’, and is ‘color of law abuse’ to ‘make or enforce’!  (‘Color of’ Means looks like but isn’t, btw)  “Law” is not determined by the opinions or will of those who make law, but by what actually fulfills its purpose: “to…establish Justice” and “protect….individual rights”!  Therefore, to ‘make or enforce’ 'any Thing...to the Contrary' of these 'clearly established' laws IS a 'crime', called 'color of law abuse' (see  Federal Criminal Codes USC 18-241&242), including ‘failure to keep from harm’ or ‘neglect to prevent’ 'deprivation of rights under color of law'! (Civil offense: USC 42-1983&1986. see:  fbi.gov/investigate/civil-rights, “Color of law”, definition, and how to file Complaints!).  <br>     
8)  ‘JUSTICE’= The most ‘fundamental principle’ in ‘The Laws of Man’, “The Common Law”, means: Fairness, Equality, balance, and that’s the reason WHY it IS a ‘color of law abuse’ to ‘make or enforce’ ‘any Thing’ which would ‘infringe’ the ‘Liberty’, property or even privacy rights, of any Human being, without evidence they most likely caused actual harm or ‘probable’ endangerment to another Humans equal ‘individual rights’!(Pg1/2)<br>
…in other words… to punish humans for any harmless activity, PERIOD, is inevitably, inexorably, ‘Contrary’ to ‘The Interests of Justice’, thus the very purpose of 'the supreme Law of the Land'! (Such Court Cases must be ‘dismissed’ ‘In the Interest of Justice’ or public servants violate their duty to ‘protect and maintain individual rights.’ ONLY!).  Anything more or less than ‘protect…individual rights’ [] is a ‘color of law abuse’ []!.<br>
9)   ‘DUE PROCESS’= The FIRST 'essential elements of due process of law are notice and opportunity to defend' ones self (US.Supr.Ct.). That’s why causing 'injury or harm' by ‘intent or inexcusable neglect’ can only be 'crime' when there is ALSO a violation of 'clearly established [criminal] law'! (Title 18 in US and 13 in Az. Laws). AND that’s why public servants violate YOUR right to ‘due process’ by refusing to read this ‘LawDoc’!<br>
10)   VOID FOR VAGUENESS DOCTRINE: Any order or legislation which people of average intelligence differ on the meaning of, or cannot understand (what it requires or prohibits), is ’not a law’ (it’s ‘void for vagueness’), BECAUSE it is ‘to the Contrary’ of ‘The essential elements of due process’, by failing to give adequate notice (U.S.Supr.Ct), and to ‘The Interests of Justice’, and thus to the very Purpose of ‘the supreme Law’ too! <br>
  “The crime, and the elements constituting it, must be so clearly expressed that the ordinary person can intelligently choose, in advance, what course it is lawful for him to pursue.” “It is a basic principle of due process that an enactment… is void for vagueness if its prohibitions are not clearly defined.” Connally vs. General Construction Co., 269 U.S. 385 (1926) ; Sewell v. Georgia, 435 U.S. 982 (1978) ; Winters v. People of State of New York, 333 U.S. 507;68 S.Ct. 665 (1948); and cases cited herein  [famguardian.org/TaxFreedom/CitesByTopic/voidforvagueness.htm  ;  caselaw.findlaw.com/us-supreme-court/269/385.html ]<br>
       11)   IMMUNITY v. LIABILITY & DUTY: IMMUNITY v. LIABILITY & DUTY: PUBLIC SERVANTS ARE PERSONALLY LIABLE and ‘not entitled to immunity’, if they ‘make or enforce’ ‘any Thing’ they ‘reasonably should know’ is ‘to the Contrary’ of 'clearly established law' like these ‘fundamental principles’, aka ‘the supreme Law of the Land’, and EVEN FOR ‘NEGLECT TO PREVENT’ ‘deprivation of rights under color of law’!  They ARE ‘immune’ to personal liability ONLY when acting ‘in good faith’ and performing ‘due diligence’ to the FIRST duty in the Oath: ‘support the Constitution’ for the United States of America (then of the State), above all else!  'Just Following orders' is not a defense for enforcing 'any Thing…to the Contrary’ of these ‘fundamental principles’, aka ‘the supreme Law of the Land’!  That’s called ‘The Nuremberg Defense’ because THAT’S WHAT ALL THE NAZIS SAID TO DEFEND THEIR ‘WAR CRIMES’! They were executed! It’s not a valid defense! (FYI: ‘failure to deny’ allegations within a reasonable time and manner results in ‘tacit consent’ by ‘acquiescence’, loss of right to dispute in court: Rule 8 in U.S.&Az. Civil Court Procedures!)  THAT’S BECAUSE PUBLIC SERVANTS MUST SWEAR AN OATH ‘to support the Constitution’ (Art.6, US.Const), and sign a contract: <br>
       12)   THE ‘STATE’= You and me!  When the cops try to say the "State" does not mean ‘Public’ property, you and me...   
   State (noun) means:   "A body politic, or society of men united together for the purpose of promoting their mutual safety and advantage, by the joint efforts of their combined strength. Cooley, Const. Lim. 1. One of the component commonwealths or states of the United States of America. The people of a state, in their collective capacity, considered as the party wronged by a criminal deed; the public; as in the title of a cause. "The State vs. A. B." The section of territory occupied by one of the United States."     [Blacks Law Dictionary, 2nd Edition, thelawdictionary.org/state-n/]<br>
       13)   WE ARE ‘SOVEREIGN’, NOT SUBJECT TO LAW/STATUTES/ETC. WITHOUT CONSENT OR INJURED PARTY… <br>
       A)  "at the Revolution, the sovereignty devolved on the people, and they are truly the sovereigns of the country, but they are sovereigns without subjects... and have none to govern but themselves; the citizens of America are equal as fellow citizens, and as joint tenants in the sovereignty."  Chisholm v. Georgia, 2 U.S. 419 (1793), U.S. Supreme Court.  [supreme.justia.com/cases/federal/us/2/419/case.html ]<br>
       B)  "No one, we believe, has ever doubted the proposition, that, according to the institutions of this country, the sovereignty in every State resides in the people of the State, and that they may alter and change their form of government at their own pleasure." <br>
Luther v. Borden  48 U.S. 1 (1849), U.S. Supreme Court. [ supreme.justia.com/cases/federal/us/48/1/case.html ]  ;  C)  "Sovereignty itself is, of course, not subject to law, for it is the author and source of law; but, in our system, while sovereign powers are delegated to the agencies of government, sovereignty itself remains with the people, by whom and for whom all government exists and acts. And the law is the definition and limitation of power." Yick Wo v. Hopkins, 118 U.S. 356 (1886), U.S. Supreme Court. [supreme.justia.com/cases/federal/us/118/356/case.html]  ;  D)  What 'sovereign' means... "The people of this State, as the successors of its former sovereign, are entitled to all the rights which formerly belonged to the King by his prerogative. Through the medium of their Legislature they may exercise all the powers which previous to the Revolution could have been exercised either by the King alone, or by him in conjunction with his Parliament; subject only to those restrictions which have been imposed by the Constitution of this State or of the U.S."  Lansing v. Smith, 21 D. 89., 4 Wendel 9, 1829, New York Court of Appeals. [facebook.com/groups/FreedomFilesGroup/921073277915255/ ;  1215.org/lawnotes/lawnotes/sovreign.htm ]<br>

Statutes don't apply to you... "[I]n common usage, the term 'person' does not include the sovereign, [and] statutes employing the phrase are ordinarily construed to exclude it."  Wilson v. Omaha Indian Tribe, 442 U.S. 653 (1979), U.S. Supreme Court.  
[supreme.justia.com/cases/federal/us/442/653/case.html ]<br>
<br>
   A ‘CRIME’ REQUIRES ALL 3 ‘ELEMENTS’: The U.S. Supreme Court REQUIRES ALL THREE ‘elements’ for a 'crime' to exist (& ‘Jurisdiction’ in a criminal court):  #1) that 'INJURY OR HARM' to some other human or their ‘equal’ ‘individual rights’ (aka 'Corpus Delicti'), was more likely than not ('probable' cause’)…  #2) CAUSED BY 'intent or inexcusable neglect' ('Mens Rea') of the accused suspect, AND…  #3) Acts ‘to the Contrary’ of VALID (See#5) 'clearly established’ criminal ‘law' (aka 'Actus Reus' - Title 18 in US, 13 in Az Laws). To punish ONLY for disobeying orders or legislation from ‘The State’ is ’TREASON’, ‘to the Contrary’ of THE PURPOSE of ‘The supreme Law’, ‘to…establish Justice… and secure the Blessings of Liberty’, and is therefore ‘color of law abuse’ to ‘make or enforce’!  AND, ‘‘…to decline the exercise of jurisdiction which is given [or] usurp that which is not given. The one or the other would be treason to the Constitution.” Cohens v. Virginia, 19 U.S. 6 Wheat. 264 264 (1821) supreme.justia.com/cases/federal/us/19/264/case.html  …‘even with a confession’ a ‘conviction cannot be sustained’ without evidence ‘injury or harm’ (Loss, Threat, Endangerment, etc.) actually occurred! [US Supreme Court, California vs San Pablo and Tulare Railroad Co., Allen v Wright, Tyler v Judges of Court of Registration, and others on 'Corpus Delicti' Doctrine].

<br>
<b>NOW LETS ADD THE CONTENT FROM “Justice System, Basic Rules”:<br>
<br>
“Justice System, Basic Rules” - KEEP ON PERSON-LEGAL DOCUMENT-</b><br>
 (To take this away during arrest/jailing/etc. deprives the holder of ‘due process’, chance to defend[8], then ‘court is deprived of jurisdiction[9], and then to not dismiss ‘would be Treason’[9]. See other documents for reference:  “The Law, for Police Encounters”, and “Law Basics, Fundamental Principles…”.)<br>
To force obedience/punish for disobeying only = enslavement (“Treason” for public servants[9])…<br>
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br>
“A frequent recurrence to fundamental principles is essential to the security of individual rights and the perpetuity of free government.“ (Arizona Constitution,Art.2,Sec.1)<br>
1) Release from Jail, Only Four Reasons to not give bail, as a matter of right:<br>
a) For felony charges when already admitted to bail on separate felony; or<br>
b) For serious felonies with illegal immigrants; or<br>
c) Capital offenses (Possible Death Penalty. See Az. Const. Ar.22,Sec.22) and certain sex offenses; or<br>
d) When accused is apparently a danger to a witness or the public; <br>
and in all four cases, only “when the proof is evident or the presumption is great as to the present offense”.<br>
[Az Const., Art.2, Sec.22 ; http://www.azleg.gov/FormatDocument.asp?inDoc=/const/2/22.htm ]<br>
  Release on own recognizance, is a right when bailable as a matter or right, unless it will not reasonably assure appearance in following court proceedings; except after a conviction, where neither bail or own recognizance is given when it is likely defendant will be sentenced to prison, unless the conviction appears likely to be over-turned in appeal, post-conviction relief, or other proceeding. <br>
[Az. Criminal procedure, rule 7.2 ; http://www.arizonacrimelaws.com/7_2.htm ]<br>
2) The "Purpose of government" is ONLY 'to protect and maintain individual rights' [Az Const, Art.2,Sec.2]. Purpose of 'the supreme Law': "We the People...ordain and establish this Constitution for the United States of America", "in order to form a more perfect Union, establish Justice, insure domestic Tranquility, provide for the common defence, promote the general Welfare, and secure the Blessings of Liberty..." [US Const., Preamble].  "This Constitution, and the Laws of the United States which shall be made in Pursuance thereof... shall be the supreme Law of the Land; and the Judges in every State shall be bound thereby, any Thing in the Constitution or Laws of any State to the Contrary notwithstanding." [US Const., Art.6. See 3)]. Thus any order or legislation which punishes people only for disobeying hired servants or written legislation, without our proper consent or evidence of injury or harm/corpus delict, is not a 'law', but 'color of law abuse' to make or enforce, violating the Oath of Office, and causing loss of 'immunity'(See #7). <br>
3) "An unconstitutional act is not a law...it is...as inoperative as though it had never been passed", Norton v Shelby County (118 U.S. 425, 1886), US S.Ct.] ; 'an act of the Legislature repugnant to the Constitution is void', 'worse than solemn mockery'. [Marbury v Madison (5 U.S. 137, 1803), US S.Ct.]; <br>
4) Any Law is 'Void’ for ‘Vagueness' when people of avg. intelligence would differ on the meaning of it, its ‘uncertain’ or ‘vague’, and any which let non-legislative officers determine its meaning or application without specific guidelines set by legislators. [Connally v General Construction Co. (269 U.S. 385, 1926), Grayned v City of Rockford (408 U.S. 104, 1972), Sewell v Georgia (435 U.S. 982, 1978). All U.S. Supreme Court, aka ‘US S.Ct’] <br>
5) Without evidence of all three elements of a crime: Corpus Delicti/injury or harm, Mens Rea/Intent or inexcusable neglect as the cause, and Actus Reus/Violation of a written, valid, criminal, “Public Law” (Not ‘void for vagueness’ nor unconstitutional);  ‘even with a confession’ a ‘conviction cannot be sustained’ without evidence ‘injury or harm’ (Loss, Threat, Endangerment, etc.) actually occurred (Corpus Delicti);  [US Supreme Court, California vs San Pablo and Tulare Railroad Co., Allen v Wright, Tyler v Judges of Court of Registration, and others on 'Corpus Delicti' Doctrine].<br>
6) The Crime 'Color of law abuse' includes 'failure to keep from harm' (www.FBI.gov definition), for which you can sue* for ‘deprivation of rights under color of law'. ‘Color of law’ means looks like law but is not, because it is contrary to the Constitution (See #s 2-5, ‘Blacks Law’ definitions of: 'color of', 'color of law', 'colorable law', US Codes 18-241 & 18-242 for criminal complaints, 42-1983 & 42-1986 for civil suits, and *=See ‘How To Administrate Public Servants’ for more ways to ‘establish Justice’. www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/18/241.html ; www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/42/1983.html ).<br>
7) "Immunity" from personal liability DOES NOT apply when a public servant 'reasonably should have known' they were violating a 'clearly established law' like the Constitution and codes (See 6, and 2-5). [New Times vs. Maricopa/Arpaio, US District Ct., 2011; US Supreme Court, Hartman v Moore, Saucier v Katz, Burns v Reed, Ashcroft v Iqbal, Pearson v Callahan, Brigham v Stuart, etc.]<br>
8) The first ‘essentials of due process of law':  Notice of legal duty and chance to defend ones self. [Simon v Craft, US v Tweel, Connally v General Construction Co., US S.Ct.]<br>
9) "Jurisdiction can be challenged at any time", then 'Court cannot proceed until proven', 'when jurisdiction appears to be lacking', 'court may ONLY dismiss' [Hagans v Lavine, Maine v Thiboutot, US S.Ct.]. "Denial of due process deprives court of jurisdiction" [Merritt v Hunter, US S.Ct.], and to take jurisdiction not given 'would be Treason to the Constitution' [Cohens v Virginia, US S.Ct.], for which one ‘shall suffer death, or no less than’ 5 years prison and $10,000 fine [18usc2381]. Failure to report evidence of Treason is a crime as well [18usc2382].<br>
10) Warrantless Search and Seizure/arrest is 'Lawful' ONLY when: there ARE 'exigent' circumstances like is an 'imminent' 'clear and present danger' to protect from, or when the time to get a warrant would likely cause loss of evidence or suspect [Huff v. City of Burbank, 2011, 9th Cir. US App.Ct.]<br>
11) "One has an undoubted right to resist an unlawful arrest, and courts will uphold the right of resistance in proper cases." [US v DiRe, (1948), US S.Ct..  Over-rules all State courts/legislation. No 'trend' in State courts can 'abrogate' this 'undoubted right' declared by the highest court.]<br>
12) Motions are deemed filed when handed to the Officer. … Notice to agent is notice to principle and Vice Versa [Source Needed].
13) "Since the revolution the people in every State are sovereign, and not subject to law, for they are the author and source of law...", "and have none to govern but themselves", unless they consent or there is evidence of a 'crime' (See 2, elements of a crime). [Yick Wo v Hopkins, Luther v Borden, Chisholm v Georgia, US S.Ct.]<br>
14) Oaths, per 38-231 of Arizona Revised Statutes, and Art. 6, US Const., require one 'to support and defend' 'the Constitution for the United States and the State', 'against all enemies foreign and domestic', 'to the best of their ability'. One is in 'dishonor' if they violate this primary obligation or forget it, as its impossible to honor an obligation one cannot even remember. That 'vitiates'/dissolves the contract/agreement. Therefore, 'just following orders' (The 'Nuremberg Defense', used by the Nazis, who were hanged), is not a defense when violating the oath, and there is no protection of 'immunity' if acts were not 'in good faith' that they were in compliance with 'law', which they must perform 'due diligence' to be certain of, 'to the best of [ones] ability'.<br>
15) The "right to free travel" is 'one of the most basic rights covered by the word Liberty in the Constitution', including travel in an automobile on public roads without a license, tag, permit, etc., UNLESS you use the roads for profit as a 'driver' (to transport people or property FOR HIRE: Blacks Law Dict.). [Slusher v Safety Coach, Shuttlesworth v Birmingham, Chicago v Chicago Motor Coach, Thompson v Smith, and 100 more].<br>
16) Right "to solicit for donations for ones self" is a right of free speech. [Az Appeals Court, Az v Boehler, 2011; US Dist. Ct., Speet/Sims v Schuette, 2012]<br>
17) "Trespass...means...except...when premises are open to the public", [ARS 13-1501, 13-1502] (See also #s 2-6).<br>
18) An unrebutted affidavit stands as a fact in a court of law Data Disc Inc V. Systems Technology Associates Inc., US 9th Cir. Ct, 1977 ; "“Silence can only be equated with fraud where there is a legal or moral duty to speak, or where an inquiry left unanswered would be intentionally misleading. . .” U.S. v. Tweel, 550 F.2d 297, 299. See also U.S. v. Prudden, 424 F.2d 1021, 1032; Carmine v. Bowen, 64 A. 932., and Rule 8 of Civil Procedure, US and Az.. Unsworn statements like police reports, taking hearsay claims from another without signature under penalty of perjury (See 28usc1746), are not admissible as evidence, and cannot be considered a 'Fact' which a judge must consider before issuing an arrest warrant.<br>
19) Names of all Govt. units and Humans must be "Proper Nouns" (only 1st Letters capitalized) by "Law" on all legal documents/official actions [US Govt. Printing Manual, Chap. 3 -Which over-rules all state laws and constitutions per art.6, US Const], [Also see Az Const., Art.28 on Official Actions in English, Art.22, Sec. 10 and 20 on Seals, Art.6, Sec. 25 on 'Style of Process' where names of parties are on court docs, and Art.1 which defines the boundaries of the State of Arizona]. And 'State' is defined in legal dictionaries as the land and 'the people, in their collective capacity...the public' [Blacks and Bouviers Law Dict.].<br>
20) "Lawful" "Money"= ONLY 'gold and silver Coin' [US Const., Art.1, Sec. 8 and 10], at about one ounce pure silver or 1/50th ounce pure gold [Coinage Acts of 1792 and 1834], NOT "FEDERAL RESERVE NOTES" which are 'debt instruments', which we pay apparently 6% interest each year to use. Since there are 1.25 Trillion in circulation, thats $76 Billion a year we pay the private-owned Intl. banks, in Gold only. "They" are: Rothschild, Warburg, Isreal Moses Seaf, Lehman and Lazard Bros, Goldman and Sachs,  Kuhn and Loeb, Rockefeller and Morgan banks, etc..<br>
21) All govt., cities, states, police, courts, etc., are 'corporations' registered on Dunn and Bradstreet (dnb.com) as 'Traded' (Through govt. bonds presumably, so you can profit from the money taken by force from people for taxes, fees, fines, etc.). Thats likely why so many people o to jail for harmless offenses, why those in legislature and highest offices try their best to increase taxes and expenses and budgets, why they take on more debt when they could be paying it off but dont, and why the Private Prison Company TMC sued (settled actually, out of court), the State of Arizona for $3 Million because the legislators failed to keep the Prison 97% full per contract (Which should never have been granted, and is unenforceable because it is a serious conflict of interest and thus unconstitutional, acting against the purpose thereof). This is also likely WHY people are arrested for not paying tax on their property (which is a rent, and you are registered as 'Tenant', until you change that at the County/Republic Recorder). We are all made into 'chattel' (Moveable) property as collateral for the national debt, through our Birth Certificates (Which create a trust, a corporation in the all caps names), and the social security number (EIN, Federal Employee Identification Number?), so we tacitly consent (by not objecting), to this...until we learn to claim the name and account, reserve all rights when signing anything or speaking in court, and re-establish our 'sovereignty'.<br>
22) Our Constitutional republic was lost in 1861, when the 1st State seceded, and congress was dissolved, because the US Govt. was exceeding its 'Lawful' authority [See Amend. 10]. Slaver was already ending naturally [See 'Causes of Secession' from each state].  The 'Reconstruction Acts' around 1865-67 made the states into corporations, and they redrafted their constitutions. The 'Missing 13th Amendment' on 'Titles of Nobility' (i.e. Sir, Esquire, Duke, etc.), was ratified in Dec. of 1812, which says: Any person who accepts or retains such a title is no longer a citizen and is incapable of holding any office of profit or trust. This was to stop foreign agents from meddling in our govt., which has happened, because those reconstruction acts took this amendment out of publishing [Google: Missing 13th Amendment images, from constitutionalconcepts.org]. The anti-Slavery Amendment (1865) was 14 for a year or two, until this redrafting happened. Then the 1868 Amendment on Equal rights (Now #14) was passed, allegedly not voluntarily, as the US Govt. used military to coerce states. 1871, Organic Act to incorporate D.C. was passed (See 28usc3002: "United States" means a 'federal corporation'). 1913, Federal Reserve Act gives all US property to intl. banks and the power to print paper money not backed with anything of real 'intrinsic value' (See #20). Then came the Income Tax (16th Amend.), ACS/AMA (Cancer societies), Rothschild and Rockefeller foundations (To manipulate public and medical educations), and more. Courts have clearly ruled (Re: 16th Amend.) that 'Congress has taxed income, not compensation', and that compensation for labor cannot be taxed as it is a 'fair exchange', but 'income' can only mean 'profit or gain'.. 1933, Emergency Banking act dissolves US Govt. in bankruptcy, HJR 192 eliminates gold backing to Dollar/Bank note, and provides ability to 'discharge debt' onto the Birth Certificate Account (need to find origin of those and Labor Taxes, beyond what’s already here). Then come Gold Confiscation acts, and suddenly the Nazis mysteriously have an enormous amount of Gold! That’s likely OURS. 1938, Erie Railroad Case, where Courts stop obeying 'Public law' (Those written by congress in compliance with Constitution), and start enforcing "Public Policy" (Statutes, ordinances, rules, regulations, codes, policies, etc.), which are 'colorable law', not necessarily 'Law' (See 2-6, Unconstitutional act not law). We are now under 'martial'/'military'/'admiralty' law, as shown in courts by the Yellow Fringe flag per Military Regulation 840-10, not in compliance with US Code Title 4 for Flag Design. Also see 1973 Senate Report on War Powers. The President is the Top CEO of a Corporation now, that is owned by the intl. banking corporations, which is how they justify him doing so many things outside the authority given by the US Const. [See 10th Amend.], and we are all property and/or employees, bound to obey, unless/until we learn how to sever this relationship, much like our forefathers did with the Declaration of Independence. That is what I am working on. Others have done it, so we can combine what they have done and improve upon it.<br>

Re: Defamation: Maybe, since you are being so dishonorable, I should take advantage of the fact you are trying to cause me harm, because what I am saying contradicts your beliefs and you must assume that you know better (Though you clearly are not checking facts, committing Logical Fallacies)...<br>
In this case, I am sure its the 'Appeal to Popularity'...well, everyone else agrees with me, so I must be right. NOPE. Through most of history, most people have been wrong about most things. Its only by CHECKING FACTS That we Gradually become less and less wrong. <br>
...<br>
In Arizona, the elements of a defamation claim are: <br>
1.  a false statement concerning the plaintiff; <br>
2.  the statement was defamatory; <br>
3.  the statement was published to a third party; <br>
4.  the requisite fault on the part of the defendant; and <br>
5.  the plaintiff was damaged as a result of the statement. <br>
Morris v. Warner, 160 Ariz. 55, 62 (Ariz. Ct. App. 1988). <br>
To be “defamatory,” a statement must be false and bring the defamed person into disrepute, contempt, or ridicule, or impeach her honesty, integrity, virtue, or reputation. Godbehere v. Phoenix Newspapers, Inc., 162 Ariz. 335, 341 (Ariz. 1989). <br>

    <br>
<br>
    Add: <br>
Where a court has jurisdiction, it has a right to decide any question which occurs in the cause, and whether its decision be correct or otherwise, its judgments, until reversed, are regarded as binding in every other court. But if it act without authority, its judgments and orders are regarded as nullities. They are not voidable, but simply void, and form no bar to a remedy sought in opposition to them, even prior to a reversal. They constitute no justification, and all persons concerned in executing such judgments or sentences are considered in law as trespassers.<br>
Elliott v. Lessee of Piersol, 26 U.S. 1 Pet. 328 328 (1828)<br>
https://supreme.justia.com/cases/federal/us/26/328/case.html<br>
<br>
<br>
    It is most true that this Court will not take jurisdiction if it should not; but it is equally true that it must take jurisdiction if it should. The judiciary cannot, as the legislature may, avoid a measure because it approaches the confines of the Constitution. We cannot pass it by because it is doubtful. With whatever doubts, with whatever difficulties, a case may be attended, we must decide it if it be brought before us. We have no more right to decline the exercise of jurisdiction which is given than to usurp that which is not given. The one or the other would be treason to the Constitution. <br>
Cohens v. Virginia, 19 U.S. 6 Wheat. 264 264 (1821)<br>
https://supreme.justia.com/cases/federal/us/19/264/case.html<br>
<br>
<br>
Every person who, having knowledge that any of the wrongs conspired to be done, and mentioned in section 1985 of this title, are about to be committed, and having power to prevent or aid in preventing the commission of the same, neglects or refuses so to do, if such wrongful act be committed, shall be liable to the party injured, or his legal representatives, for all damages caused by such wrongful act, which such person by reasonable diligence could have prevented; and such damages may be recovered in an action on the case; and any number of persons guilty of such wrongful neglect or refusal may be joined as defendants in the action; and if the death of any party be caused by any such wrongful act and neglect, the legal representatives of the deceased shall have such action therefor, and may recover not exceeding $5,000 damages therein, for the benefit of the widow of the deceased, if there be one, and if there be no widow, then for the benefit of the next of kin of the deceased. But no action under the provisions of this section shall be sustained which is not commenced within one year after the cause of action has accrued.<br>

Identify And Publicly Expose Biased, Prejudiced And Corrupt Judges!<br>
<br>
<br>
Early identification of a Bad Judge may be the single most important factor in your litigation. Once one notices a Judge is bad, you can practically guarantee it is only going to get worse. If it is too late to help in your own case, exposure helps prevent similar judicial abuse for subsequent litigants.

Here are a bunch of pages I was looking at for sources from the US Supreme Court saying how an “Affidavit” IS “evidence” enough for “probable cause” for arrests and “criminal prosecution” and is NOT just “hearsay”, so my police SHOULD have arrested that guy and SHOULD have given me a proper criminal complaint signed “under...perjury” and SHOULD be recording or buffering the video from the highway cameras which WOULD Have recorded these two guys wrecking my bicycle (on 2.15.2022.  So I was searching for the word “affidavit” in these pages, and I think the Jones and Terri and Hiibel and Rugendorf cases seemed like some of the best US Supr.Ct. Cases for this point):<br>

HERE IS THE OLD CONTENT FOR THIS PAGE, for now until I have this HUGE amount of info organized better...
<br>
<br>
I plan to make a summary of the 'fundamental principles' of 'the supreme Law of the Land' and 'the commmon law' here:<br>
<a href="https://www.facebook.com/permalink.php?story_fbid=965117453669816&id=517986018382964">https://www.facebook.com/permalink.php?story_fbid=965117453669816&id=517986018382964</a><br>
<br>
And I have already summarized these 'fundamental principles' many times in some of these 'LawDocs' here on www.NRDL.org and www.GovernPublicServants.com, and on my Facebook pages like 'FundamentalPrinciples' in that top 'Pinned Post', and I plan to use that page to share these in the future (and I keep getting better and wording them shorter and clearer). <br>
<br>
NOW ON THIS PAGE I NEED TO PUT TOGETHER A PROPOSAL FOR POTENTIAL DONORS AND CONGRESS TO FUND A PROJECT TO ELIMINATE EVERYTHING "TO THE CONTRARY" OF OUR "SUPREME LAW OF THE LAND" AND FIX ALL THE "ABUSES AND USURPATIONS" OF OUR CONSTITUTIONAL REPUBLIC, so to start I'll put a link to the Facebook Post I made for this Fundraiser here: <br>
<a href="https://www.facebook.com/donate/1245511165788693/1245511215788688/">Here is where I posted on Facebook my plans for this Fundrasier, HOW I plan to 'establish Justice... and secure the Blessings of Liberty to ourselves and our Posterity', with all the donations I receive:<br>
